      </strong>{" "}
      As an avid enthusiast of whisky, I (<i>like many others</i>) found myself
      overwhelmed by the vast landscape of scotch. I built this website in an
      effort to expand my knowledge of this exquisite drink, as well as
      demonstrate my continued learnings in web development.

      <strong>Hi! I'm Chris.</strong>
    </p>,
    <p>
      I've spent my professional career working various tech jobs, but just
      recently started learning how to become a full-stack developer myself.
      This is one of many websites I built to practice web development. This
      website was built using the MERN stack, specifically the next.js React
      framework and the Material UI component library. If you want to see some
      of my other websites, you can check out my portfolio website{" "}

        here
      </a>
      .
    </p>,
    <p>
      As far as scotch goes, I can't say it's my preferred drink of choice, but
      it's definitely one of my favorites. My friends Garrett and Frank first
      turned me on to Talisker sometime in college, and then I gradually began
      branching out and trying more scotch brands on my own. To this day,
      Talisker is still my favorite scotch.
    </p>,
    <p>
      I was fortunate enough to visit Scotland in 2016, but didn't have enough
      time to do a proper distillery crawl. I hope to visit again sometime in
      the future and really do it right.
    </p>,
    <p>
      Anyhoo - I hope you found some value in visiting my silly little site.
      Hopefully you got something out of it, and maybe are preparing to pour
      yourself a glass of scotch at this very moment. As the Scottish writer
      David Daiches once said -

    <p>
      <em>
        {" "}
        "The proper drinking of Scotch whisky is more than indulgence: it is a
        toast to civilization, a tribute to the continuity of culture, a
        manifesto of man’s determination to use the resources of nature to
        refresh mind and body and enjoy to the full the senses with which he has
        been endowed."

        Scotch whisky (<em>often simply called Scotch</em>) is malt whisky or
        grain whisky made in Scotland. Scotch whisky must be made in a manner
        specified by law.
      </p>,
      <p key="whatis-2">
        All Scotch whisky was originally made from malted barley. Commercial
        distilleries began introducing whisky made from wheat and rye in the
        late 18th century. Scotch whisky is divided into five distinct
        categories: single malt Scotch whisky, single grain Scotch whisky,
        blended malt Scotch whisky (formerly called "<em>vatted malt</em>" or "
        <em>pure malt</em>"), blended grain Scotch whisky, and blended Scotch
        whisky.
      </p>,
      <p key="whatis-3">
        All Scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three years.
        Any age statement on a bottle of Scotch whisky, expressed in numerical
        form, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that
        product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed-age
        whisky. A whisky without an age statement is known as a no age statement
        (<strong>NAS</strong>) whisky, the only guarantee being that all whisky
        contained in that bottle is at least three years old.

        Generally, the United States and Ireland refer to their beverage as
        "whiskey", whereas other countries in Europe and Asia will use the term
        "whisky". Where the original variation in spelling came from is still a
        matter of debate. Legend has it that during the 1800s, most Scotch
        Whisky was considered as very low quality: because of this, American and
        Irish distillers began adding the “e” in order to show a point of
        distinction to consumers that the quality of their whiskey was higher
        than that of Scotch.

        According to the Scotch Whisky Association, Scotch whisky evolved from a
        Scottish drink called <em>uisge beatha</em>, which means "
        <strong>water of life</strong>". The earliest record of distillation in
        Scotland occurred as long ago as 1494, as documented in the Exchequer
        Rolls, which were records of royal income and expenditure. The quote
        above records eight bolls of malt given to Friar John Cor wherewith to

        Whisky production was first taxed in 1644 by the Scottish Customs &
        Excise (known affectionately as <em>Gougers</em>), causing a rise in
        illicit whisky distilling in the country. This drove many distillers to
        move to rural areas such as the glens, highlands and islands to set up
        illicit stills and avoid paying duty on the whisky they produced. In
        1690, <strong>Ferintosh Distillery</strong> became the first commercial
        whisky distillery in Scotland as a result of Duncan Forbes of Culloden
        gaining exemption from paying the whisky duty. On a related note, the
        title of "oldest distillery in Scotland" is often a topic of debate,
        with the likes of popular brands such as Bowmore, Glenturret, and
        Strathisla all vying for the honor.

      <p key="17th-2">
        Between the 1760s and the 1830s a substantial unlicensed trade
        originated from the Highlands, forming a significant part of region's
        export economy. In 1782, more than 1,000 illegal stills were seized in
        the Highlands: these can only have been a fraction of those in
        operation. The Lowland distillers, who had no opportunity to avoid
        taxation, complained that un-taxed Highland whisky made up more than
        half the market. The heavy taxation during the Napoleonic Wars gave the
        illicit trade a big advantage, but their product was also considered
        better quality, commanding a higher price in the Lowlands. This was due
        to the method of taxation: malt was subject to tax (at a rate that
        climbed substantially between the 1790s and 1822). The licensed
        distillers therefore used more raw grain in an effort to reduce their
        tax bill.

        With an ever growing demand for whisky from outside the Scottish
        borders, unauthorised distillation was ubiquitous by the 1820s. Nearly
        half the whisky drunk in Scotland came from illicit stills, with no
        payment of duty, even though Excise Gaugers seized up to 14,000 illicit
        stills every year.
      </p>,
      <p key="19th-2">
        The Highland magistrates, themselves members of the landowning classes,
        had a lenient attitude to unlicensed distillers - all of whom would be
        tenants in the local area. They understood that the trade supported the
        rents paid. Imprisoned tenants would not be able to pay any rent. In
        1823, Parliament eased restrictions on licensed distilleries with the "
        <strong>Excise Act</strong>", while at the same time making it harder
        for the illegal stills to operate. Magistrates found counsel for the
        crown appearing in their courts, so forcing the maximum penalties to be
        applied, with some cases removed to the Court of Exchequer in Edinburgh
        for tougher sentences. Highland landowners were now happy to remove
        tenants who were distillers in clearances on their estates. These
        changes ushered in the modern era of Scotch production: in 1823, 2.2
        million gallons of whisky had duty paid on it; in 1824 this increased to
        4.3 million gallons.
      </p>,
      <p key="19th-3">
        Two events helped to increase whisky's popularity: first, the
        introduction in 1831 of the column still; the whisky produced with this
        process was generally less expensive to produce and also less intense
        and smoother, because a column still can perform the equivalent of
        multiple distillation steps in a continuous distillation process.
        Second, the phylloxera bug destroyed wine and cognac production in
        France in 1880.

    description: [
      <p key="20th-1">
        Perhaps one of the most significant developments in the history of
        Scotch Whisky was the use of oak casks for maturation. During the 1700s
        and 1800s, whisky was most likely drunk unmatured; however, oak wine,
        sherry and port casks were the most appropriate vessels available to
        store and transfer whisky at that time. It was soon recognized that
        long-term storage in oak casks greatly improved the color, aroma and
        taste of whisky and removed many of the harsher characteristics of the
        unmatured spirit. It eventually became a requirement in the 1900s that
        all whisky be matured in oak casks for a minimum of three years. Today
        it is recognised that the wooden cask in which a whisky is matured is
        perhaps the single most important factor in creating its flavor.

        Single malt Scotch whisky is made using an age old process, beautiful in
        its simplicity. It uses natural, raw ingredients:{" "}

        Although traditional Scotch whisky is made from exlusively 100% malted

        <strong>
          <em>British Corn Laws</em>
        </strong>{" "}
        in 1846 allowed Scottish distillers to begin creating blended whisky and
        grain whisky as scotch. In this guide, we will break down the
        similarities in both the malt whisky process (which utilizes a{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>pot still</em>
        </strong>
        ) as well as the blended/grain whisky process (which utilizes a

        The barley is first screened to remove any foreign matter and then
        soaked for two or three days in tanks of water known as{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>steeps</em>
        </strong>
        . After this it is spread out on a concrete floor known as the malting
        floor and allowed to germinate. Germination may take from 8 to 12 days
        depending on the season of the year, the quality of the barley used and
        other factors. During germination the barley secretes the enzyme
        diastase which makes the starch in the barley soluble, thus preparing it
        for conversion into sugar. Throughout this period the barley must be
        turned at regular intervals to control the temperature and rate of
        germination.
      </p>,
      <p key="malting-2">
        At the appropriate moment germination is stopped by drying the malted
        barley or green malt in the malt kiln. More usually nowadays malting is
        carried out in Saladin boxes or in drum maltings. in both of which the
        process is controlled mechanically. Instead of germinating on the
        distillery floor, the grain is contained in large rectangular boxes
        (Saladin) or in large cylindrical drums. Temperature is controlled by
        blowing air at selected temperatures upwards through the germinating
        grain, which is turned mechanically. A recent development caused by the
        rapid expansion of the Scotch Whisky Industry is for distilleries to
        obtain their malt from centralized maltings which supply a number of
        distilleries, thereby enabling the malting process to be carried out
        more economically.

        Both Malt and Grain Whisky must be matured after distillation has been
        completed. The new spirit is filled into casks of oak wood which, being
        permeable, allows air to pass in and evaporation takes place. By this
        means the harsher constituents in the new spirit are removed and it
        becomes in due course a mellow whisky. By Scottish law, any whisky to be
        considered scotch whisky must be aged in oak barrels for at least three
        years. Malt Whisky which contains more of these flavory constituents
        takes longer to mature than Grain Whisky and is often left in the cask
        for 15 years or even longer. The period of maturation for both Malt and
        Grain Whisky is also affected by the size of casks used. the strength at

        the degree of color will vary from one whisky to another. Whisky matured
        in former fresh oak sherry casks will usually be a darker color than

      <p key="packaging-1">
        The final stage in production of Scotch Whisky is labelling and
        packaging. Most Scotch Whiskies are marketed at home and abroad in
        branded bottles. A Scotch whisky label comprises several elements that
        indicate aspects of production, age, bottling, and ownership. Some of
        these elements are regulated by the <em>Scotch Whisky Regulations</em> (
        <strong>SWR</strong>), and some reflect tradition and marketing.
      </p>,
      <p key="packaging-2">
        The label always features a declaration of the malt or grain whiskies
        used. A single malt Scotch whisky is one that is entirely produced from
        malt in one distillery. One may also encounter the term "
        <strong>
          <em>single cask</em>
        </strong>
        ", signifying the bottling comes entirely from one cask. The term "
        <strong>
          <em>blended malt</em>
        </strong>
        " signifies that single malt whisky from different distilleries are
        blended in the bottle. The Cardhu distillery also began using the term "
        <strong>
          <em>pure malt</em>
        </strong>
        " for the same purpose, causing a controversy in the process over
        clarity in labelling – the Glenfiddich distillery was using the term to
        describe some single malt bottlings. As a result, the Scotch Whisky
        Association declared that a mixture of single malt whiskies must be
        labelled a "blended malt". The use of the former terms "vatted malt" and
        "pure malt" is prohibited. The term "blended malt" is still debated, as
        some bottlers maintain that consumers confuse the term with "blended
        Scotch whisky", which contains some proportion of grain whisky.
      </p>,
      <p key="packaging-3">
        The brand name featured on the label is usually the same as the
        distillery name (for example, the Talisker Distillery labels its
        whiskies with the Talisker name).In addition to requiring that Scotch
        whisky be distilled in Scotland, the SWR require that it also be bottled
        and labelled in Scotland. Labels may also indicate the region of the
        distillery (for example, <em>Islay</em> or <em>Speyside</em>).
      </p>,
      <p key="packaging-4">
        Alcoholic strength is expressed on the label with "
        <em>Alcohol By Volume</em>" (<strong>ABV</strong>) or sometimes simply "
        <em>Vol</em>". Typically, bottled whisky is between 40% and 46% ABV.
        Whisky is considerably stronger when first emerging from the
        cask—normally 60–63% ABV. Water is then added to create the desired
        bottling strength. If the whisky is not diluted before bottling, it can
        be labelled as{" "}
        <strong>
          <em>cask strength</em>
        </strong>
        .
      </p>,
      <p key="packaging-5">
        A whisky's age may be listed on the bottle providing a guarantee of the
        youngest whisky used. An age statement on the bottle, in the form of a
        number, must reflect the age of the youngest whisky used to produce that
        product. A whisky with an age statement is known as guaranteed age
        whisky. Scotch whisky without an age statement may, by law, be as young
        as three years old. In the early 21st century, such "No age statement"
        whiskies became more common, as distilleries responded to the depletion
        of aged stocks caused by improved sales. A label may carry a
        distillation date or a bottling date. Whisky does not mature once
        bottled, so if no age statement is provided, one may calculate the age
        of the whisky if both the distillation date and bottling date are given.
      </p>,
      <p key="packaging-6">
        Labels may also carry various declarations of filtration techniques or
        final maturation processes. A Scotch whisky labelled as "
        <strong>
          <em>natural</em>
        </strong>
        " or "
        <strong>
          <em>non-chill-filtered</em>
        </strong>
        " has not been through a filtration process during bottling that removes
        compounds that some consumers see as desirable. Whisky is aged in
        various types of casks—and often in used sherry or port casks—during
        distinct portions of the maturation process, and will take on
        characteristics, flavor and aromas from such casks. Special casks are
        sometimes used at the end of the maturation process, and such whiskies
        may be labelled as "
        <strong>
          <em>wood finished</em>
        </strong>
        ", "
        <strong>

        Glenfarclas means ‘

          <em>valley of the green grass</em>

        distillery. Indeed, the distillery farm ran from the late 1790s until
        1988. Like so many of the oldest sites, the farm buildings would have
        been pressed into service as a site for illicit distillation prior to
        the <strong>1823 Excise Act</strong>. It took a further 13 years for
        original owner <strong>Robert Hay</strong> to take out a licence. When
        Hay died in 1865 his neighbour <strong>John Grant</strong> bought the
        distillery for £512. It has remained in his family’s hands ever since.

        Although The Glenlivet is widely believed to be the oldest operational
        distillery in Scotland, it isn’t. That honor is up for debate - often
        going to Strathisla, while others like Glen Garioch could be even older.
        The Glenlivet was however one of the first to take out one of the new
        licences issued after the passing of the{" "}

        starting point of the modern Scotch whisky industry.

        <strong>George Smith</strong> was the man who did it. A farmer (which in
        those days in this region pretty much meant an illicit distiller), he
        had the <strong>tack</strong> ("<em>rent</em>") of the Upper Drumin farm
        in the southern part of Glen Livet. As it was his landlord, the Duke of
        Gordon, who had helped to push the Act through, there was little chance
        that Smith wouldn’t get a knock on the door from the Duke’s factors
        "persuading" him to mend his ways.

        Not that this was without danger. Whisky smuggling had been underway for
        almost 40 years by that time and the gangs were both well-established
        and relatively wealthy. Plenty of the new distilleries were razed to the
        ground. George Smith famously travelled with a pair of pistols in case
        he was attacked by his former colleagues.

      <p key="glenlivet-4">
        His venture was a success, and his Glenlivet whisky – conceivably made
        in a lighter style even at this stage – became popular. As the money
        came in, he took the tacks of Minmore and Nevie and with demand rising,
        built a second distillery at nearby Delnabo in 1850. His Edinburgh
        agent,
        <strong> Andrew Usher</strong>, then released "<strong>OVG</strong>"" ("
        <em>Old Vatted Glenlivet</em>") initially as a vatted malt and then the

        the first of many trips to Islay in 1878 to learn the secrets of

        The reason so many existing Islay distilleries came into being before
        the "official" 1824 start date is down to the influence of Islay’s
        laird, <strong>Walker Frederick Campbell</strong>. Islay was less
        brutally cleared than other islands and as an "improving" landlord,
        Campbell was keen to start new businesses on the island. Islay already
        had a reputation for moonshine, so legal distilling made sense. The fact

        of the <strong>1823 Excise Act</strong>. In 1868,{" "}

        For a distillery which has become synonymous with the growth of single

        strongly on the then new single malt category.

      <p key="macallan-3">
        A firm belief in the fusion of the oily, heavy, new make style and
        ex-Sherry casks saw Macallan, under Edrington’s governance, become the
        first distillery to create so-called "<em>bespoke</em>" casks: selecting
        specific trees (predominantly in northern Spain, though some American
        oak is specified), and then with Jerez-based cooper Tevasa specifying
        the length and nature of drying, type of coopering, the liquid used for
        seasoning ("<strong>oloroso</strong>") and the duration of that process.

        back to 1926, and the Masters of Photography series. This has not been
        without controversy. Its growing status as a collectable malt saw
        Macallan become the victim of fakers in the late 1990s. The subsequent
